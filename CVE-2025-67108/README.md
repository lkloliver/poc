## Description of the example


## Run the example

### Secure Hello world publisher

```shell
user@machine:example_path$ ./security publisher
Publisher running. Please press Ctrl+C to stop the Publisher at any time.
```
### Secure Hello world subscriber

```shell
user@machine:example_path$ ./security subscriber
Subscriber running. Please press Ctrl+C to stop the Subscriber at any time.
```

All the example available flags can be queried running the executable with the ``-h`` or ``--help`` flag.

### Expected output

Regardless of which application is run first, since the publisher will not start sending data until a subscriber is discovered, the expected output both for publishers and subscribers is a first displayed message acknowledging the match, followed by the amount of samples sent or received until Ctrl+C is pressed.

### Secure Hello world publisher

```shell
Certificate will expire at: XXXX-XX-XX
Created temporary profile: 
Publisher running. Please press Ctrl+C to stop the Publisher at any time.
Publisher matched.
Message: 'Hello world' with index: '1' SENT
Message: 'Hello world' with index: '2' SENT
[Publisher] ⚠ WARNING: Certificate has expired!
Message: 'Hello world' with index: '3' SENT
...
```

### Secure Hello world subscriber

```shell
Subscriber running. Please press Ctrl+C to stop the Subscriber at any time.
Subscriber matched.
Message: 'Hello world' with index: '1' RECEIVED
Message: 'Hello world' with index: '2' RECEIVED
Message: 'Hello world' with index: '3' RECEIVED
...
```

When Ctrl+C is pressed to stop one of the applications, the other one will show the unmatched status, displaying an informative message, and it will stop sending / receiving messages.
The following is a possible output of the publisher application when stopping the subscriber app.

```shell
...
Message: 'Hello world' with index: '8' SENT
Message: 'Hello world' with index: '9' SENT
Message: 'Hello world' with index: '10' SENT
Message: 'Hello world' with index: '11' SENT
Publisher unmatched.
```
