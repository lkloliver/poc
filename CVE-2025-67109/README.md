## Build Steps

1. **Build project**
   ```bash
   cd /home/svf/cyclonedds_security_test
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

2. **Generate expired certificates **
   ```bash
   cd /home/svf/cyclonedds_security_test
   ./setup_security.sh
   ```
## Running Tests

1. **Start subscriber** (in one terminal)
   ```bash
   cd /home/svf/cyclonedds_security_test/build
   ./bin/SecuritySubscriber
   ```

2. **Start publisher** (in another terminal)
   ```bash
   cd /home/svf/cyclonedds_security_test/build
   ./bin/SecurityPublisher
   ```

## Notes

- The publisher uses certificates valid from 2023-01-01 to 2024-01-01, which are expired
- The subscriber certificates are also expired
- Due to certificate expiration, certificate validation failures may occur
- Paths in configuration files are relative paths, programs need to be run from build/bin directory


## Security Configuration

- Enable encrypted communication (ENCRYPT)
- Enable access control
- Enable discovery protection
- Enable metadata and data protection
